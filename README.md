## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple Mini App built for our System Integration & Architecture laboratory activity.  
It demonstrates basic user authentication features such as Register, Login, Logout, Dashboard, and Profile pages using a React web application.  

The current version uses a **fake authentication system (no backend yet)** for demonstration purposes.  
Future versions will integrate a real backend API.
